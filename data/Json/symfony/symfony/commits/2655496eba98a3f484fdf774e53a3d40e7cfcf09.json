However, when using the `website-skeleton` (which is what most newcomers use ... and they are the ones that mostly need the \"Welcome Page\") the premise about *\"no routes are defined\"* is never true and the Welcome Page is never shown (see https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/9178 for one of the multiple error reports we've received).\n\nSo, I propose to make this change to always define the \"Welcome Page\" as the fallback:\n\n* If no routes are defined for `/`, the Welcome Page is displayed.\n* If there is a route defined for `/`, this code will never be executed because it's the last condition of the routing matcher.\n\nCommits\n-------\n\n5b0d9340d7 Display the Welcome Page when there is no homepage defined",
